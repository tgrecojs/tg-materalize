                Thank you for visiting my web application. My name is Thomas Greco, and I am a software engineer based out of New York City. Currently, my main focus is building both web and mobile applications using JavaScript. That being said, my main areas of expertise are AngularJS, NodeJS, Sass CSS, and I have written a number of articles on using these technologies, as well as many others, for different companies. In addition to working in software development, I come from a background in graphic design, and I am extremely proficient with using different Adobe Creative Cloud Applications. Specifically, I have an extensive bit of knowledge in using PhotoShop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro.</p>

                As of late August, I became the newest member of the SitePoint Premium Team. SitePoint Premium (formerly Learnable) provides users with access to books, video tutorials, and is really a great resource for those looking to learn development. The topics I have been dealing with range from creating build systems with GruntJS, to understanding the <code> module.exports </code> statement in JavaScript.
